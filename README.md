Hello!

During my time in ecology, I've noticed that there are some very technical aspects to ecological analysis - from botany to geospatial regression models - whose explanations and guides are simply not easy to understand. 

To that extent, I was keeping notes for myself and figured they would be better to be shared instead of me keeping the information for myself.

I hope this helps, and if anything is ever unclear, please let me know.
